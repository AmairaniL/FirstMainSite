  <p id=description>
    There was a young boy that lived in the woods. He would never ever leave his
    home because of the stories he was told. There were different stories that
    were told to him when he was young. The father told him there are hungry
    wolves that lived in the woods that the moment he steps out he will be eaten.
    The mother told him there are fairies that always guide lost childrent away
    from their homes and never come back. Finally his older brother told him that
    there are young elves that wait for him to bully and beat him up for his money.
    The young boy never wanted to leave until a young wondering girl approaches
    his house. Thats when this boy's life changed....
